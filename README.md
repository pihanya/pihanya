    <strong>Tale about one stubborn guy</strong> (2 minutes read)
  </summary>
  <br/>
  Once upon a time, there was a tiny 👶 baby boy. His name was Misha.<br/>
  Since he started walking, a great passion for 💻computers lived inside this little kid.<br/>
  Years were passing by, Misha was growing, and his curiosity grew with him.<br/>

  When the kid reached 14, he decided to find out how is it — to be a programmer 👨‍💻<br/>
  
  It was difficult for this curious guy to learn the craft of programming 😣<br/>
  as he was born and lived in a tiny village where people used to think that programmers are just some special sub kind of magicians.<br/>
  He just had nobody to discuss his interests with. Nobody could help when it was hard. Nobody could understand him.... 🥺<br/>
  But Misha never gave up and was following his dream!

  Day by day he was overcoming hard deadlocks that seemed hopeless until the efforts gave their first harvest 🌱<br/>
  The sun had come out from behind the clouds — the boy, at last, got a first job at the age of 16 👨‍💼<br/>
  Misha was hired as Java Developer — just as he imagined it in his dreams ✨<br/>
  Succeeded boy understood that he is happy with his new great passion — programming.

  A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since Misha got his first job.<br/>
  But one thing has always been and always will remain unchanged: success doesn't come to you... you go to it by yourself 🎯

  My name is Misha and this was a story of my youth.
  Thank you for reading!
